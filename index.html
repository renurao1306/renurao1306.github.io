    <title>Renu Rao's Resume</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Hello there!</h2>
    <p>I am Renu Rao, a recent graduate of Mumbai University with a degree in BSc. IT. Born and raised in the ever-bustling city of Mumbai, I strive to learn new concepts every day, coupled with loads of fun! These days Machine Learning and the numerous python libraries used for training ML models has piqued my interest. 

        I'm an active listener and can easily adapt to working with a team or independently. My 'attention to detail' trait helps me focus my thoughts in all areas of a project/task, no matter how small, and thus stand out. 
        
        Being a voracious reader, books feel like home to me. I also like to doodle and create beautiful intricate mandalas in my free time. 
        
        I would like to contribute to building full-stack applications so please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
